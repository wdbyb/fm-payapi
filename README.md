## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- 7-1 Sass Architecture
- BEM

### What I learned

Recalled HTML markup and Sass 7-1 architecture. Used basics Sass features and tried to follow Web accessibility standards. Optimized images for different screens.

### Continued development

Will focus on more advance Sass techniques, and try to use more generic classes in styling.
